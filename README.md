# Sweet Nook Restaurant Page

A dynamic restaurant page for a dessert shop called "Sweet Nook" built using JavaScript modules and Webpack. This project demonstrates how to create a single-page application with multiple tabs that dynamically render content without page reloads.

## Description

Sweet Nook is a fictional dessert shop website with three main sections:
- **Home**: Displays basic information about the restaurant, including opening hours and location
- **Menu**: Shows a selection of delicious desserts with descriptions and prices
- **Contact**: Provides contact information for the restaurant

The entire page is built using JavaScript DOM manipulation, with each section (Home, Menu, Contact) separated into its own module. The content is dynamically rendered when clicking on the navigation tabs without reloading the page.
